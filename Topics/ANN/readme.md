Illustration of computational graphs mapping an input to an output where
each node performs an operation. Depth is the length of the longest path from input to
output but depends on the definition of what constitutes a possible computational step.
The computation depicted in these graphs is the output of a logistic regression model,
s(wT x ), where s is the logistic sigmoid function. If we use addition, multiplication and
logistic sigmoids as the elements of our computer language, then this model has depth
three. If we view logistic regression as an element itself, then this model has depth one.
