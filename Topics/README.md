Will Starting with MLP/ANN
1) 2 layer perceptron to train a model to do logical operation.
2) using 
   - stochastic gradient descent optimization
   - binary_crossentropy loss function
   - uniform_initializer
   - linear activation function
   - accuracy as the metrics

Challenge - We will discuss why XOR function is not learnable using above perceptron.
