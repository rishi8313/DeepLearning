# DeepLearning
This repository is for exchanging knowledge about DeepLearning

- I have added a file in the repo Installation_Intruction.txt rather than having the instructions in readme file.
   
- I have added Topics.txt which contains some topics with which we can start.

- I have added Topics/ANN folder, where you will find the simplestANN.ipynb file.

   This file can be viewed in GIT itself without any software installation.
