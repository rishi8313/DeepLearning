Below are the steps to setup Keras environment

Download anaconda from the following link

1) For windows - https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-4.4.0-Windows-x86_64.exe
   
   For linux   - https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-4.4.0-Linux-x86_64.sh 
   
   For Mac     - https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-4.4.0-MacOSX-x86_64.pkg
   
2) Installing will not be problem for most of you I guess ;)
   
   For Linux installation -
   
   Make sure you add the path in ~.bashrc file, The installer will ask to add, please select yes.

3) We need to setup a virtual environment inside anaconda for DeepLearning.

4) There are 2 ways (as per my knowledge) of creating virtual environments inside anaconda
   
   a) GUI way using anaconda navigator
   
   b) CLI way
   
Note: Creating environment will help you in case you screw something, otherwise you will have
   
   to install anaconda again.
   
I can only provide the CLI way for windows and Linux machine as I don't have MAC machine.

I don't prefer GUI :D

Steps to create the virtual env are listed below

1) press Windows key and search for anaconda prompt, run anaconda prompt.
   
   On Linux machine Open Terminal ;)
   
2) Type conda create -n <environment_name> python=3.6
   
   Ex : conda create -n conda_env_Deep_Learning python=3.6
   
   You will see a prompt like shown below. Proceed by pressing y then enter.
   
   The following NEW packages will be INSTALLED:

    pip:            9.0.1-py36_1
    
	python:         3.6.1-2
    
	setuptools:     27.2.0-py36_1
    
	vs2015_runtime: 14.0.25420-0
    
	wheel:          0.29.0-py36_0

	
	Proceed ([y]/n)? y
	
	On Linux machine you might get some more packages. Just proceed.

3) Step 2 will take time to collect the needed packages to create an environment and will setup
   
   Python 3.6 env.
   
4) Once completed. Type: 
		
		activate <environment_name> for windows users
		
		source activate <environment_name> for linux users
   
   Ex : activate conda_env_Deep_Learning
      
	  : source activate conda_env_Deep_Learning
   
5) You will get a prompt as shown below:
   
   (conda_env_Deep_Learning) C:\
   
   On Linux machine similar prompt will appear
   
6) This sets up your environment

Now its time to install some packages using pip and conda

1) Install tensorflow using the commands
   
   pip install tensorflow
   
2) You will need some more packages for handling the data and scientific calculations
   
   a) conda install scipy - includes installation of mkl (Large in bytesize: download over Wifi)
   
   b) conda install numpy 
   
   c) conda install pandas
   
   d) conda install matplotlib
   
   e) conda install notebook - Its an easy to use IDE. 
                               I will be sharing all the sample codes in notebook format.

3) Next install Theano using
   
   conda install theano - If you want to use theano as backend of Keras
   
   The above command will also install the C/C++ dependencies and compiler which is required by theano.

4) Then install Keras using 
   
   pip install keras
   
   Keras is wrapper around DeepLearning Libraries like Tensorflow (Google's) , 
   
   Theano(not sure ) and CNTK (Microsoft's Deep Learning Library)

And!! We are done...

type python on the console and press enter

You will get a prompt as below:

>>> import keras

Using Tensorflow backend

>>>

If you see this we all are good to go.
